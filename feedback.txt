General
 - No one likes Ballet (explain it)
 / Don't change exp reqs (ok)
Byron
 - Crops should not be loose (just put them in people's inventories)
 - Garden need a better UI (one table per player? item sprites? completion bar?)
 - Mobs page needs art (enemy art, also prpbably a better ui)
 √ Phones should last longer (compromise: more phones)
 - Voting is redundant (no change yet)
 - Just re-use dragons (no change yet)
 X Digging through old pages for information is bad (there aren't that many pages and dragon info is on the first post of fs2)
 X Stop focusing on lore (no)
 / Just tell us the lore (maybe)
 - Update schedule should be more consistent (working on it)
 - Types are too complicated (have you played pokemon?)
Not Gilbert
 √ Need more places to call (added three buisness already (you need to find them))
 - Make a form for voting (might vote on it)
 - Make a vote on the pet system (mkay)
Theta?
 X Garden needs to be scrapped (then how would farming work)
 / Mobs seem pointless (where else would you get wool or feathers or bones)
 / Don't get the point of the phones (sorry, not sure how to explain it better)
 - Voting is redundant (no change yet)
 - Make a vote on the pet system (got it)
 - 1 pet per player, extra equip slot (seems reasonable)
 X Looks too much like Minecraft (sorry but i need sprite inspiration from /somewhere/)
 - Inventory/Structure system could give early players an advantage (kind of how all multiplayer games work; removing inventories would break 3/4 of the game and structures aren't actually locked)
 - Remove the type system (just tell me what needs explaining)

Here's how they work:<ul><li>The icon in the corner is your <b>type</b>. You can ignore it for now.</li><li>The large white text is your <b>username</b>. You should know what that is by now.</li><li>The text on the right of the upper box is your <b>Player Level</b>. It goes up when you do certain things.</li><li>The box with the heart on the left is your <b>HP</b>. If it hits 0, you'll get KOd, which basically removes you from the game for 2 turns.</li><li>The box with the sword and shield is your <b>attack</b> and <b>defense</b>. Attack is on the left, Defense on the right.</li><li>Attack and Defense can be split into two parts: <b>current</b> and <b>base</b>. Current is what you currently have, while Base is what you'd have if you removed all non-permanent stat boosts.</li><li>Current and Base can also be broken down into two parts, <b>indirect</b> and <b>direct</b>.</li><li>Indirect and Direct are basically the X and Y of 1dX+Y, the roll used to determine what will be used as your attack or defense.</li><li>The box with the swinging sword and broken shield is your <b>kills</b> and <b>deaths</b>.</li><li>A Kill can be achieved two ways; either do something that would reasonably kill someone (such as throwing them off a cliff), or bring them to 0 HP.</li><li>A Death is achieved by being on the receiving end of a Kill.</li><li>The table labled 'Effects' contains your <b>effects</b>. Effects are basically just things that are happening to you right now, such as 'on fire' or 'soaked by the rain'. This table might not be present.</li><li>The table below the effects table contains your <b>skills</b>. Skills are things you are good at; having a high Mining skill means you are good at mining. This table also might not be present.</li><li>The bar of icons is your <b>equipment</b> bar. Equipment is items you put in your equipment bar to give you bonuses, like a stat boost. (Note: some equipment may give things that aren't bonuses.)</li></ul>" id="info-stat-table" onmouseover="info('info-stat-table');" onmouseout="noinfo();"></span>

Skeledop - Turn 22
how did i forget this
[quote=Byron_Inc_TBG]I rebuild the fireproof/explosionproof wall, and make it waterproof, electroproof (wait what), and most importantly, shockwave-proof.
I also repair my barrier wall.[/quote]
That's a lot of proofs. This might take a while. (1/3)
[quote=solitare]i somehow end up in the north pole
the only things that can be used for resources are fish, ice, polar bears, and seals

i find a sharp icicle to use for hunting stuff and fishing[/quote]
Skill roll: 1d20-5(No tool) = [color=green][b]20[/b][/color]-5 = [color=green][b]15[/b][/color]
Somehow you end up at the North Pole?!?!?
Unfortunately you spawn above the ground.
Fall damage roll: 1d5+10 = [color=red][b]1[/b][/color]+10 = [color=red][b]11[/b][/color]
You stick the landing. ([color=transparent]It was a Critical Miss.[/color])
Skill roll: 1d20 = [color=green]16[/color]
You find an [i]Icicle[/i].
[quote=Joyous Theta]I'm not sure how you expect to suddenly wind up at the North Pole, there's a people firing cannon you can use to get here though if you want to.

I finish the bean farm and plant many cans of beans (10/10), starting with unpotting the potted canned bean bush and moving it into the farm.

Afterwards, I set up a fishing net in the hopes that the plastic container filled with frozen beans eventually randomly drifts into it.[/quote]
You plant the [i]Canned Bean Bush[/i].
(As a bush, it behaves a little differently: It needs to reach 5 to be harvestable, but starts at 2 after you replant it. Since it's already grown, it starts at 2.)
(Canned Beans are hardy and last an extra turn before rotting.)
The [i]Fishing Net[/i] has been created... at the North Pole?
[quote=IncendiaryGaming]The War Tank's construction is at the final stage now.[/quote]

([color=transparent]No, really. Could you explain?[/color])
[quote=Byron_Inc_TBG]I build another layer of everything-proof (yep that's what I called the improved version) walls (1/2).
I prepare, upgrade and add weapons to my fortress.
I also dig a moat around my castle (1/3).[/quote]
You're too busy with the first layer of walls to do any of that!

Here it is!

The fact that people are going to the North Pole, and thus out of range of everyone else, is starting to get annoying. And if [i]everyone[/i] goes to the North Pole, we'd miss the plot! So I propose one of two things: either [u]sending everyone back to Trisland[/u], or [u]making a portal between Trisland and the North Pole[/u].
I myself vote for option A.
...yes, you're voting between them. You can also vote for none. Also we haven't had a vote since Turn 4???

The mushroom cloud above Unisland starts dissipating.

Plants grow.
The [i]Spinach[/i], [i]Beans[/i], [i]Potatoes[/i], [i]Cabbage[/i], and [i]Radishes[/i] are all now harvestable.
LeopardyLeaf's [i]Carrots[/i] ripen. Hurry, before it rots!

...uh, you guys [i]are[/i] paying attention to the plot, right? If you are, mention green beans somewhere in your post so I know.

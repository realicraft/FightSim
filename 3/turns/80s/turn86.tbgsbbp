(this is not a move, hopefully)
I suggest a vote to explicitly say the current tracked location of the players. This would support the structural defense mechanism that's just been suggested.
}
Why do a vote when I can just do it now?
You can now see your location in your stats table.

{quoteall|realicraft|691468|1698195731|Makes sense to me, though you probably should have equipped your Diamond Sword first. Or not, it's up to you.}
Wait, you have to explicitly say that you have to equip it to use it?

Okay then. I'll equip my Diamond Sword and attack 2 random people, just to utilize my Attack Up powerup.

Hop up on the Spyglass Overlook and use my thin-air spyglass to check who's in the boat.
Ring the doorbells on the Base Under The Island, Byron's Fortress, the Storage Room, the Explosives Room, and the Food Storage Room.
Ring the doorbells on the Ore Room, Defense Room, Shelter, Reinforced Wall and Cave In The Ice.
}
You go onto the Spyglass Overlook and pull out a thin-air Spyglass to look at the boat.
It's not entirely clear from this distance, but it looks like there's one occupant, who's most likely human, given how you can see multiple colors, whereas a dragon or something would probably be mostly one color.
You can't really figure out their height without anything nearby to reference, but they seem to be a little bit taller than the boat is long? Oh, and the boat looks like it's been taken straight from Minecraft.â€ 
They're also probably male, but it's hard to tell from this distance.

Thus, the Turn 87 skeledop will not be posted until a little after that. Or on Monday the 29th, whichever comes later.â€ â€ 


* The first candy drop is guaranteed to be a Pumpkin-Shaped Chocolate.
** You need to roll at least a 16 (after bonuses) to get any Hardite Ore, and at least a 24 for targeting Hardite to give bonus ore.
â€  Yes, I looked up the length of Minecraft boats {i|and} the average human height by age.
â€ * I'll be honest, I myself was not aware of this until I looked at the table of Proficiency/Mastery bonus to work on the TBGs Wiki article about the game.
â€ ** Yes, Allies can get Skill Expirience, though this isn't shown on the website. They also can hold items, too; ally inventories are two rows of 12 slots, and also aren't shown on the website.
â€ â€  Yes, that is indeed over a week from now. You see, there's apparently a global protest going on from the 21st to the 28th, so I'm participating in that. Sort of.

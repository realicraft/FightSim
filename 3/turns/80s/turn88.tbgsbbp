Skeledop - Turn 88
how about we try that again
edit: yikes
{hr2}
Last turn, I didn't handle quests until the end of the turn, and ended up missing a few quest completions, so I'm putting them here.
Fares completed a quest! ({bi|Equip a Golden Food.}) He obtains 3 Gold Bars, 150% Farming, and 10 Misc EXP. (Fares's Farming skill leveled up!)
Incendiary completed a repquest! (Harvest Crops.) She obtains 1 Misc EXP.
Incendiary completed a repquest! (Use/Equip Scrolls, Upgrades, Stickers, Chocolates, or Lucky Blocks.) She obtains a Lucky Block.
Incendiary completed a repquest! (Use/Equip Scrolls, Upgrades, Stickers, Chocolates, or Lucky Blocks.) She obtains 2 Lucky Blocks.
Gilbert completed a repquest! (Use/Equip Scrolls, Upgrades, Stickers, Chocolates, or Lucky Blocks.) He obtains a Lucky Block.

}
You eat some of your cookies, and gain 14 HP.
This makes room for two queued items, which are random scrolls.
Item roll: 2d64 = 50, 12
You obtain a Scroll of (33) (36) and a Scroll of Large (12).
You open your Mistery Gift.
Item roll: 1d741+8 = 459
You obtain a Mining Upgrade.
You cast your Scroll of (22) (4) on Byron, and all of his plants lose half a growth turn! (Except for his Golden Carrots, which go down to 0.)
Byron's Potatoes are no longer harvestable.
It looks like this is a Scroll of {b|Shrink Plants}. So that means that rune 22 is {b|Small/Shrink}, while rune 4 is {b|Plant/Plants}.
This makes room for a queued Heart-Shaped Chocolate.
You've completed a repquest! (Use/Equip Scrolls, Upgrades, Stickers, Chocolates, or Lucky Blocks.) You obtained a Lucky Block.
...which you don't have room for, so it's been queued.

- I store everything that isn't my tools or food in my storage room
- Loot the stocking
- Equip Reimu
- Harvest my apples
}
You only have room for fifteen items in your Storage Room, so you only move your Logo 3, 54 Stone, 12 Iron Bars, Old Candy, Lucky Block, two Electrum Bars, three Leather, two Grapes, two Flint, five Amethyst Shards, Time Candy, 13 Oak Logs, four Bottles o' Enchanting, four Birch Logs, and 14 Emeralds.
Some queued items enter your inventory.
(You obtained 10 Flame Arrows, 3 TNT, and a Heart-Shaped Chocolate.)
You then empty out your Filled Stocking into your inventory, causing the Stocking to disappear.
You equip the Reimu Hakurei Fumo.
You can't harvest your apples, because you're out of actions!

{spoiler|egg|iappeartohave}

You equip the Santa Hat that was in your inventory.
You can't craft a pair of Diamond Leggings, as you need a Crafting level of 1, but only have a Crafting level of 0. Maybe try crafting a bunch of sticks first, or something.

*eats the Time Candy*
"Hmm, I feel like attacking someone else, but I'm not sure who should I attack..."
"Oh I know! I'll use the Esolang to tell me what player to attack!"
}
You eat a Time Candy.
You use the Esolang as a simple random number generator.
{esocode|global/func/output/print.int<((global/func/random.randint<{1}-{6}>))>:}{esooutput|5}

{hr2}
Well, that went quickly; only took negative one months!

...wait.
Considering how long this turn took, it's probably not a good idea to start any new events, so I'll instead be implementing some smaller versions of them right now.
{list|{*|Some random day from last June:â€ * everyone gets a Slice of Ice Cream Cake.}
{*|Halloween '24: everyone gets a Chocolate Bar and a Pumpkin-Shaped Chocolate.}
{*|Christmas '24: everyone gets a Time Candy and a Mystery Gift.}
{*|Valentines '25: everyone gets a Heart-Shaped Chocolate.}

So.
It's been a while, huh?
It turns out I need this thing called "motivation" to work on FS3 - and to be quite frank, you guys are kinda terrible at providing it.
Oh well; I'm sure the next turn won't take as long.
...mainly because it's a bit hard to beat {i|ten months}.

...hey, what happened to the website?

* I'm not sure that's actually useful right now.
** Yes, while frozen; it just makes you unable to move (as in from one location to another).
â€  Somehow, this only gave 5 Combat Exp. ...I'm probably going to rebalance that at some point.
â€ * Okay, fine, this was for my birthday last year.

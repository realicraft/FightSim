The vote to change how Blocking works has finished. Actually I think it might have finished earlier, but I'm not sure.
It got 1 Yes and 1 No, resulting in a percentage of 50%. As the vote required a supermajority, or for over two-thirds of the votes to be Yes, it has failed to pass.

Two people have gotten some Misc EXP for harvesting crops.
Reali obtained 1 Misc EXP.
Byron obtained 6 Misc EXP.

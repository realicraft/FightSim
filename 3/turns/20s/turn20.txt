Turn 20 - Skeledop

[quote=Byron_Inc_TBG]I keep my harvested plants (that'll be a few trips, picking up all other vegetables) in my storage room.


Wait, wait, wait. The TNT should be something like Minecraft TNT, it's an item, not a structure.[/quote]
You move the plants. (You can do that in the same turn you harvest stuff.)
My bad.
[quote=solitare]i start growing beetroot[/quote]
You plant Beetroot. (0/3)
[quote=Joyous Theta]Sure, you do that.

I continue to work on the cool bean farm (8/10) and finish the rocket loaded with ice (4/4), launching it towards Byron's bean crops to lower their temperature.[/quote]
(Are you referring to the idea of making making plants instant?)
Unfortunately, the rocket is too heavy to throw, so you'll need to ma- oh wait it has an engine
The rocket is traveling towards the bean crops. (0/3)

The plants (including the Beetroot) grow.
LeopardyLeaf's Carrots are ready to harvest.

The good news is that the thing in the sky is heading towards that other island, not us. The bad news is that it's a nuke, and will probably hit somewhere around... next turn.
Hope your stuff is shockwave proof!
(Yes, Turn 21 [i]is[/i] next week, but that's by coincidence (due to the vacation), rather than being an [i]intentional[/i] cliffhanger. Oh well.)

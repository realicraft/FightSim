Turn 18 - Skeledop
I'm thinking of changing the update schedule from "when i feel like it" to "two or three times a week"
mainly to give cool off time

[quote=solitare]i go caving, trying to find diamonds
(why am i playing this like text-based minecraft)[/quote]
Skill roll: 1d20 = 6
You find nothing but rock and disapointment. (Your Mining skill has increased by 10%.)
[quote=cheesyfriedeggs]I harvest the cabbage.[/quote]
Skill roll: 1d20 = [color=red]2[/color]
Alas, you accidentally break it all. And it was ripe, too! At least there are still some seeds. (Your Gardening skill has increased by 5%.)
[quote=LeopardyLeaf]I build a carrot farm.[/quote]
The [i]Carrot Plant[/i] has been created.
[quote=Joyous Theta]I continue making the bean farm (5/10) before building an intercontinental rocket loaded with North Pole ice aimed at Byron's bean crop. (1/4)

((Maybe we should vote for some official farming support since everyone is doing that? Not sure what would be added since the current system seems to be fine but it's an idea.))[/quote]
I feel like that's overpowered, but there's basically no other way for you to attack other players, so I'll let the missile slide (as long as it only targets part of the island.) Also how does a farm take longer to make than a [i]missile[/i]?
As for the gardening support I'm going to move the plants to their own page on Sunday.
[quote=Faressain][quote=realicraft]Turn 17 - Skeledop
Leaving this one for the morning.
Fares, I think you have the wrong idea here. In-universe ([color=transparent]can't believe i have to say that[/color]), Fighting Simulator isn't a game. It's a bunch of people, on an island, trying to fight eachother. Look, how about you [url]read FS1[/url] and try to do something similar to what you did then. [color=transparent]reading fs2 is just going to give you the wrong idea[/color]
As for you're points on species, I'd like you to explain how, say, a human could fly without wings, or a dog could pickup and use a sword. ([color=transparent]Magic is probably going to end up overpowered if I "balance" it (badly).[/color])
I feel like it would be best if species only affected the game in small but reasonable ways - which would require most, if not all, playable species to be humanoid. (Y'know, somewhat human-shaped?)
The stat idea sounds good, although I feel like something like, say, scales would provide a natural defense boost. Would probably limit stat changes to at most 10% off from standard. ([color=transparent]claws would probably only apply an attack boost if you explicitly use them[/color])
[/quote]
(Making a point there, human can create a plane or use a paraglider, and if any artpiece gives ponies (that ALSO have as much dexterity as dogs) ability to pick up and use swords, by wielding it in its mouth and moving it to swing. Then again, there's going to be difficulties for creation with one, and adapting with other.

Ret: [color=#C30567]You gotta be kidding me, Flask. You're arguing with Nef, and I still don't have my effin' post yet!? Hurry up![/color]
[color=#3355BE]Whoops. Sorry, will do it in a hour.[/color]

Also uh, your GMing style accidentally makes it feel for some people, like solitiare, that they're doing basically Minecraft, which is a game. [s]Unless for some reason it becomes Destroy the Godmodder simulation.[/s] For example, how often do you fly to north pole IRL or stripmine for diamonds somehow?

Yeah, 10% deviation on HP/Attack, alternatively -1 def for +2 Attack and vice versa sounds fine-

Ret: [color=#C30567]Okay, I'm hijacking his profile up, and saying this. I approve of IBCMs with preferably nuclear pay-[/color]
[color=#3355BE]Stop it! *kicks Retribution off*[/color])

I continue settling up the small base ignoring any and all complaints or claims. Putting a blue flag there too, to mark the ownership. (3/12)[/quote]
...what? Your post is confusing me. What's with the second person? Are you trying to provide commentary? Is that supposed to be a second character? I think I forgot to specify you only get one character, did that confuse you? (Probably assumed people would assume you only get one character.) You know, FS3 [i]does[/i] have a plot. I've been hinting at it a few times. Remember when the islands blew up? Island[b]s[/b] plural? (Don't worry about the plot not being revealed for a long time, it'll be front and center on Turn 21.) So, you probably shouldn't try to add your own plot, it'll just confuse things.
As for the rest of your post:
I feel like planes would be a bit overpowered, although you won't be able to visit the other islands until around Turn 60, for plot reasons. I'm telling you that in case you were going to try.
...makes it feel what?
One of the nice things about Fighting Simulator 3 is you can pretty much play how you want. Want to grow a bunch of food? Sure. Want to gather materials to improve your attack? Go for it. Want to go to the North Pole? That's a thing you can do. If solitare wants to go stripmining for weapon materials, they can. Also, you can summon things out of basically nowhere. I could summon a sword. Do you know anyone who can do that in real life?
Yeah, small stat variations would probably be okay. You still have to vote for [u]playable species[/u], though.
12 turns is a really long time to build a base. You should really go for something like 5 or 6. (Or you could ask someone to help, I guess. Might need to gain their trust first, though.)
[quote=Byron_Inc_TBG]I harvest my golden carrots and set up some turrets by the top floor (aka the roof) of my fortress.[/quote]
Skill roll: 1d20 = [color=green]19[/color]
You harvest 6 bundles of Golden Carrots, plus an Enchanted Golden Carrot. (Your Gardening skill increases by 70%. Your Gardening level increases to 1! You now have a +2 on Gardening rolls.)
You leave the Cabbage to ripen. (Careful, a crop can only spend one turn ripened before rotting.)
The [i]Turrets[/i] have been created on the [i]Fortress[/i].
[quote=Joyous Theta]I still continue making the bean farm (6/10) before continue building the intercontinental rocket, painting it with invisible paint so that it can't be seen by turrets so they won't get in the way of maximum bean cooling. (2/4)[/quote]
Oh, [i]that's[/i] why you guys are making large counters, becuase you can increase it by two each turn! Not sure how I didn't realize that.
Anyway, the rockets have paint now. Presumably, the ice will also block the heat signature, but might cause the rockets to have some sort of "cold signature" instead. Just something to think about.
[quote=IncendiaryGaming]Move operations to a military base for now.[/quote]
Ooh, I've been wanting to bring this running gag back. [i]ahem[/i]

[quote=solitare]i end up provoking a skeleton while caving
(you can do 2 things in 1 turn, right)[/quote]
(Yes, you can.)
Oh no, you encounter an enemy! Oh, wait, [u]random enemy encounters[/u] aren't a thing...
You continu caving.
Skill roll: 1d20 = 5
You find more rock and disappointment. (Your Mining skill has gone up by 10%.)
[quote=Byron_Inc_TBG]I make some TNT (1/2)[/quote]

The Beans and Potatoes have grown and are ready to harvest. (3/3)

By the way, to reach level [i]n[/i], you need (50*([i]n[/i]+1))% in that skill (so reaching 1 requires 100%, reaching 2 requires 150%, reaching 5 requires 300%, and so on.)

[h]Update Schedule[/h]
From now on, FS3 will only update on [b]Wednesday[/b] and [b]Saturday[/b]. The skeledops for those updates will be posted the day before, on [b]Tuesday[/b] and [b]Friday[/b]. This means that Turn 19 will release on July 21st, and Turn 20 on July 24th. (This is all based on PST.)
Also, I'll be on a vacation (like, actuall "go somewhere with the family" vacation) from I believe Monday the 26th to Friday the 30th. (The actuall dates might be different.) This means that Turn 21 will release on July 31st, not July 28th. (I should be able to make a skeledop while on vacation.)

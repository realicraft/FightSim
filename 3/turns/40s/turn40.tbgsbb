augh, this took too long

*Golden Food can't be ripe, to decrease clutter. (The Bundle of Golden Ripe Spinach in your base is now a bundle of Golden Spinach.)
**Having Proficiency in a skill means your at level 5 or greater. This nets you a bonus, listed on the info page. The levels after 5 have diminishing returns; levels 6 to 10 only give you +1 to a skill roll per level, and the exp requirement increases by 100 each level, instead of 50.
***You know how the formula for exp gains from multiple rolls is avg({exp gains})/((2+{number of rolls}))/2? Well, {number of rolls} has diminishing returns now. Basically, each roll after the fourth is only counted as half a roll, up to the eighth roll, after which rolls are ignored for the purposes of {number of rolls}.

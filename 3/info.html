        <h2>Formatting</h2>
        <p>
            FS3 uses various types of formatting to signify different things.
            <br>
            This section will show what the various types of formatting mean.
            <br>
            <b>Bold</b> text signifies an effect.
            <br>
            <em>Italic</em> text signifies something that is on the island that everyone fights on.
            <br>
            <u>Underlined</u> text signifies something that could be added by voting on it. 
        </p>
        <h2>Types</h2>
        <p>will format later</p>
        <pre>There are 8 types: [color=gray]Normal[/color], [color=orange]Fire[/color], [color=blue]Water[/color], [color=yellow]Electric[/color], [color=green]Plant[/color], [color=cyan]Ice[/color], [color=lightgray]Light[/color], and [color=darkgray]Dark[/color].
The type effectiveness works like this:
[code]
               Dark ->  Normal  -> Light              
    Water, Electric ->   Fire   -> Plant, Ice         
         Plant, Ice ->  Water   -> Fire               
               Dark -> Electric -> Fire, Dark         
               Fire ->  Plant   -> Water, Light       
               Fire ->   Ice    -> Water              
Dark, Plant, Normal ->  Light   -> Dark               
    Light, Electric ->   Dark   -> Normal, Electric   
[/code]
Additionally, some effects behave differently with certain types. Specifically:
[quote]On Fire: Fire types are healed rather than harmed, Ice and Plant types take +2 damage per turn, Water types take -1 damage per turn and have a 20% chance per turn to have the effect tick down an extra turn.
Frozen: Ice types gain a +3 defense boost rather than the standard effects, and Water types have a 20% chance per turn for the effect to not tick down.
Paralysis: Electric types gain a +3 attack boost rather than the standard effects, and Dark types gain a -2 attack loss.
Poisoned: Dark types are immune, and Light types always take damage.[/quote]
You can change type at any time, but it takes effect at the end of the turn.

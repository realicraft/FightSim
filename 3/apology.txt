Theta, I noticed you had been fine with what's happened so far until I created the vote. That unusually quick turn-around concerns me, and as someone who once was also quick to get angered, I can't in good faith simply follow your request and remove you from the game like you were never there. I'll make it so that certain sections of the website related to you aren't visible, but they'll be still be present in the source code, in case you change your mind and want to come back. It was never my intention to upset you, but the reason I made the vote was because, in a game where the goal is to fight people, being unable to be fought due to being in another location is simply too overpowered, and I had to deal with it somehow. It may have [i]looked[/i] like one could just [i]appear[/i] at the North Pole, but solitaire only made it there because they rolled a natural 20, and if you can still get a Critical Miss despite having a buff, you can get a Critical despite having a debuff.
I tried to deal with the issue in a manner that left you in control, but it's clear I messed that up, and for that, I apologize. I hope you'll change your mind and start playing again, but it's okay if you don't.
